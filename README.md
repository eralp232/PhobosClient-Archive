# Phobos Client Archive
You can find the source code and jar files for all versions of Phobos Client here.
### Why?
I noticed that GoPro's GitHub account was down, which meant all the Phobos client source codes and jar files were gone. So, I tried my best and collected all the Phobos source codes and jar files from other forks. I needed it for my archive anyway, so why not?
