# Phobos Client Archive
You can find the source code and jar files for all versions of Phobos Client here.
### Why?
I realized that Gopro's github account was no longer available and because of that all phobos client source code was no longer available, so I collected all phobos source code from other forks. It was also needed for my archive, so why not.
